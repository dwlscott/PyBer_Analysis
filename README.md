# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

For this assignment we were to use our knowledge of Python and Panda, in order to assess and create a new Data frame,  for the ride-sharing data by city type. As well a create a Multy-line graph that show the relationship between the city and fares for each city type. To assess how ride sharing can be improved for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results:
After breaking down the data, we compiled a summary frame to display all the data into a cohesive Data Frame. When we break it down further. It shows that for the total rides, rural had 125 riders, Suburban had 625 riders, and Urban areas had 1,625. Continuing on, the total drivers per area makes sense. See Urban areas had 2,405 drivers, while suburban, and rural had less 490, and 78. The total fares for Rural was $4327.93, Suburban, $19,356.33, and Urban was 39,854.38. Now here is where things get interesting. When looking at the Data for Average Fare per Ride in Rural areas it was the most expensive. At an average of $34.62. While Suburban and Urban were lower at $30.97 and $24.53. Now the average fare per driver was highest in Rural areas $55.49, $39.50 in suburban areas and in Urban areas it  was the lowest at $16.57. So what does this all actually mean? Well for each city, a lot of the data is inversely related. Meaning in larger areas there were more rides, and drivers, the cost was lower and the profits were higher. But that is not exactly the case for Rural and Suburban areas where profits were lower, cost per rides were higher. But the average fare per driver was higher. See table below.

Now when comparing the total fare by city type line graph. The data does add up. When we look at the Urban line in yellow. It showed us that it had the most fares per city type. Peaking in late February, beginning of March, late march and beginning of April. Totalling $39,854.38. Same for Suburban areas, they were not as high. But it did also have a peak in fare in late February,  and a decline in the beginning of April.  Last for Rural areas was the lowest in terms of fares but it did seem to peak in late february, and April.

## Summary
As we conclude this assignment, one can conclude that there is a noticeable difference in ride-sharing depending on what area one lives in. More concentrated areas are often going to have more drivers, cheaper fares. As opposed to Rural areas where fares will be more expensive due to less drivers and proximity to places. Some ways that this could possibly be resolved in areas of less populations,  and proximity. Would be more of a group ride share. Not along the lines of a bus. But more like a few transit vans. That would circle the town maybe every 30 minutes to an hour. For more suburban areas, where there are closer places. But still a ways away. One could introduce electric scooters or bikes. And for larger Urban areas, possibly partner with the department of transportation, and do like a universal public transportation pass.
